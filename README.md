### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the Jacob Lab at Yale University. I am interested in understanding the molecular underpinnings of ðŸŒ± development and how they can be manipulated for beneficial ends. My current work involves developing new tools for ðŸŒ± genome engineering, mainly in *Arabidopsis thaliana* but I also think about *Citrus* species.

I am also interested in reproducible research practices, R programming and data science.
